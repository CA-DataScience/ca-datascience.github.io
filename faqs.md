# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is data science?
Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It combines statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to analyze large amounts of data.

## What skills do I need to become a data scientist?
A data scientist typically needs skills in programming (Python, R), statistics, machine learning, data visualization, and domain knowledge in their field of application. SQL and database knowledge are also valuable.

## How do I start learning data science as a beginner?
Start by learning a programming language like Python, followed by statistics fundamentals. Then move to data manipulation libraries (pandas, numpy), visualization tools, and finally machine learning concepts. Practice with real datasets from platforms like Kaggle.

## What's the difference between data science and machine learning?
Machine learning is a subset of data science. Data science covers the entire process of acquiring, cleaning, and analyzing data, while machine learning focuses specifically on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns from data.

## What tools do data scientists use?
Common tools include programming languages (Python, R), libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), notebooks (Jupyter), database query languages (SQL), and visualization tools (Matplotlib, Tableau, Power BI).
