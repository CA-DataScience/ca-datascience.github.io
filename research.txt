# Pushing Your Local Jekyll Site to GitHub Pages: A Complete Guide

Before diving into the specifics, let me highlight that GitHub Pages offers free web hosting for static sites, making it perfect for Jekyll-powered websites. With the proper configuration, you can quickly take your local Jekyll site and make it publicly accessible with just a few steps.

## Setting Up a GitHub Repository

The first step is creating a repository on GitHub to host your Jekyll site:

1. Sign in to your GitHub account and click the "+" button in the upper-right corner, then select "New repository"[12].
2. Name your repository appropriately. If you want a user or organization site, name it `.github.io` or `.github.io` (with lowercase letters). For a project site, you can choose any name[10][4].
3. Add a description if desired and choose the repository visibility (public repositories are required for GitHub Free accounts)[10][4].
4. Select "Initialize this repository with a README" to create an initial commit[12].
5. Click "Create repository"[12][4].

## Configuring Your Jekyll Site for GitHub Pages

Before pushing your site to GitHub, you need to properly configure it:

### Understanding `baseurl` and `url` Settings

The `baseurl` and `url` settings in your `_config.yml` file are crucial for proper functioning on GitHub Pages:

1. For a user or organization site (`username.github.io`):
   ```yaml
   url: "https://username.github.io"
   baseurl: ""
   ```

2. For a project site (repository with any other name):
   ```yaml
   url: "https://username.github.io"
   baseurl: "/repository-name"
   ```

The `baseurl` is only needed when your site is hosted in a subdirectory[5][9]. Setting it incorrectly is one of the most common causes of broken links and missing assets[5].

### Important Notes About `baseurl`

- Always start `baseurl` with a forward slash and don't include a trailing slash: e.g., `/repository-name`[13][14].
- When using `baseurl`, you must properly reference assets and links in your Jekyll templates:
  ```html
  
  
  
  
  About
  ```
  
The `relative_url` filter ensures your links work both locally and on GitHub Pages[7][5].

## Pushing Your Jekyll Site to GitHub

Now that you have your repository and configuration set up:

1. Initialize Git in your local Jekyll site directory (if not already done):
   ```
   git init
   ```

2. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
   ```
   Replace USERNAME and REPOSITORY with your GitHub username and repository name[2].

3. Add and commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initial GitHub pages site with Jekyll'
   ```

4. Push your site to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Or push to master if that's your default branch[2].

## Configuring GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

After pushing your Jekyll site to GitHub:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click "Settings" in the repository menu.
3. In the left sidebar, click "Pages" under "Code and automation"[2][4].
4. Under "Source," select your publishing source (typically "main" or "master" branch)[4].
5. Click "Save"[4].

GitHub will now build your Jekyll site using GitHub Actions. This process may take up to 10 minutes for your site to publish after pushing changes[2].

## Accessing Your Public Site

Once GitHub Pages has built your site:

1. You'll see a green success message in the Pages section of Settings with a link to your published site[2].
2. Your site will be available at:
   - For user/organization sites: `https://username.github.io`
   - For project sites: `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Broken Assets and Links

If your CSS, images, or other assets aren't loading:

1. Check your `baseurl` setting in `_config.yml`[5][9].
2. Make sure all your links use the proper filters (`relative_url` or `absolute_url`) or include `site.baseurl`[5][7].
3. Verify paths to your assets are correct relative to your site structure[14].

### Local Development with `baseurl`

When developing locally with a `baseurl` set:

1. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
2. Access your site at `http://localhost:4000/your-baseurl/` (include the trailing slash)[13][14].

Alternatively, you can create a development config file (`_config_dev.yml`) with:
```yaml
baseurl: ""
```

And run Jekyll with:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml
```

This overwrites the `baseurl` setting for local development while preserving it for GitHub Pages[14].

## Conclusion

With these steps, you've successfully published your Jekyll site on GitHub Pages. Your site is now publicly accessible, and any changes you push to the designated branch will automatically update your published site. This approach gives you the flexibility of developing locally while leveraging GitHub's free hosting platform for public access.

Remember that GitHub Pages uses Jekyll behind the scenes, so your site will be automatically built when you push your source files-no need to push the generated `_site` directory[7].

## Additional Features

Consider exploring these additional features for your GitHub Pages site:

1. Custom domains: Configure your GitHub Pages site to use your own domain name[4].
2. Jekyll themes: Customize your site's appearance using pre-made themes[1][6].
3. GitHub Actions: Create custom workflows for more advanced site building and deployment scenarios[2][11].

By following this guide, you've taken the first steps toward maintaining a professional, publicly accessible Jekyll website hosted for free on GitHub Pages.
